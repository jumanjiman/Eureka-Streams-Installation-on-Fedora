=== Documentation tools

This document is available in source form on Github.
Building the document requires three tools:

* 'Asciidoc' provides a lightweight markup syntax
  and a command-line tool to convert source content
  into Docbook format. The Asciidoc package is available
  in the standard Fedora `yum` repositories.

* 'Publican' provides tools to convert Docbook source
  into publication-quality PDF and HTML formats.
  Publican is available in the standard Fedora `yum` repositories.

* 'Engagement-Journal' provides a command-line tool (`ej`), attempting
  to simplify document creation using Asciidoc and Publican.
  `ej` automatically creates a buildable, template document and
  places the document under Git version control.
  Engagement-Journal is available from Github at the URL
  listed below.
