== Executive Summary

This chapter provides a high-level overview of the project.

=== Scope

This document provides detailed instructions for installing
Eureka Streams on Fedora Linux. The instructions probably
relate closely to the steps needed to install on other
distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Centos.

Installing Fedora Linux is well-documented and is beyond
the scope of this document.


=== Technologies used

This project incorporates the following major technologies:

* Eureka Streams
+
Lockheed Martin created this project to enhance
internal collaboration among teams and individuals.

* Fedora Linux 11
+
Red Hat and a worldwide community develop Fedora Linux
as a parallel project with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

* Memcached
+
This provides in-memory caching and an API, improving
performance for data-intensive applications.

* Java
+
This fourth-generation language aims to provide
cross-platform compatibility.

* Maven >= 2.0.6
+
Apache Maven is a software project management and
comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project
object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
reporting and documentation from a central piece of
information.

* Postgres
+
PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database
management system (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL
constructs (including transactions, subselects and
user-defined types and functions).


=== Challenges and Risks

// This section describes issues encountered during delivery.
// Emphasis should be on Cause-Effect-Workaround


==== Dynamic Maven projects

It is difficult to produce a reliable, reproducible
build for any project based on Maven. Even though the
upstream Maven plugins are stable and buildable, the
versions of dependencies are continually evolving.
Thus a project may build today, but tomorrow it fails
due to version incompatibilities.

The Eureka Streams project provides a number of Maven
dependencies within the Eureka Streams repository.
These dependencies are the correct version, but Eureka
Streams and its Maven plugins require additional
dependencies, which are evolving.

Perhaps a better approach would be to include a static
version of every Maven dependency within a repository
to ensure a reproducible build.
