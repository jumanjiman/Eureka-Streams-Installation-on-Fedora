==== Bash Scripting

{client} admins should develop Bash scripting skills. 
I spent some time with the Linux team to cover scripting
and command-line navigation.  Using scripts to
automate management tasks provides useful benefits:

.Benefits of Bash scripting
* Understand how system scripts operate
* Resolve run-time issues with servers
* Ability to test scripts before running in production
* Avoids risk of entering commands by hand on production servers
* Reproduce tasks efficiently
* Over time, build a library of common scripts

.Free, self-study resources

The following two resources are freely available online
and provide a great reference for individuals who prefer
to self-study.

.Instructor-led training
For instructor-led training with labs, Red Hat offers a course
that includes Bash scripting and Linux command-line skills.
