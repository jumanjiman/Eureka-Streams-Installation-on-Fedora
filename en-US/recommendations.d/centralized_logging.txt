==== Centralized logging

We should consider making *rsyslog* a part of the baseline
build. A centralized log host can be virtualized and addressed
using a DNS CNAME, such as *syslog01*. This would allow
the virtual host to be relocated as needed without impacting
existing configurations.

****
Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, among
others, MySQL, syslog/tcp, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists,
filtering on any message part, and fine grain output format
control. It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used
as a drop-in replacement. Its advanced features make it suitable
for enterprise-class, encryption protected syslog relay chains
while at the same time being very easy to setup for the novice
user.

==== Event correlation

{client} should consider 
installing *Simple Event Correlator* (*SEC*) on the `syslog` host.

See http://simple-evcorr.sourceforge.net for more information on *SEC*.

SEC is an open source and platform independent event correlation tool
that was designed to fill the gap between commercial event correlation
systems and homegrown solutions that usually comprise a few simple
shell scripts. SEC accepts input from regular files, named pipes,
and standard input, and can thus be employed as an event correlator
for any application that is able to write its output events to a
file stream. The SEC configuration is stored in text files as rules,
each rule specifying an event matching condition, an action list,
and optionally a Boolean expression whose truth value decides whether
the rule can be applied at a given moment. Regular expressions, Perl
subroutines, etc. are used for defining event matching conditions. SEC
can produce output events by executing user-specified shell scripts
or programs (e.g., snmptrap or mail), by writing messages to pipes
or files, and by various other means.

SEC has been successfully applied in various domains like network
management, system monitoring, data security, intrusion detection,
log file monitoring and analysis, etc. The applications SEC has
been used or integrated with include HP OpenView NNM and Operations,
CiscoWorks, BMC Patrol, Nagios, SNMPTT, Snort IDS, Prelude IDS, etc.
