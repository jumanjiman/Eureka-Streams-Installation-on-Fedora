==== Disable unnecessary services

A number of services are enabled by default and can
be disabled to save resources. The following code snippet
can be added as a standard part of `%post` in a 
baseline kickstart. 

[source,shell]

include::../files/disable-services[]

The script reports its actions in `/var/log/messages`, as 
shown in this example output:
