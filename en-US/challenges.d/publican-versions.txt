==== Publican versions

*Publican* embeds a _product_ version number in the title of the document.
This is really annoying, but fits within the design goals of *Publican*.

Sigh...to get rid of it:

. Edit `en-US/Book_Info.xml`
. Find the tag `<productnumber>0.1</productnumber>`
. Change it to read `<productnumber></productnumber>`
. Rebuild by running the `make all` command

NOTE: A future version of the `ej` command will probably
do this for you.
