==== DNS Architecture

Any network infrastructure based on TCP/IP protocols should
have a well-designed DNS. This document provides work-arounds
for an infrastructure in which DNS is less than optimal.

.Causes
* Lack of heirarchical delegation to subdomains
* Missing `A` records
* Inconsistent `cname` records
* Improper forwarders

.Effects
* Hosts cannot reach each other
* Kerberos-based authentication fails

.Workarounds
* Pre-populating the `/etc/hosts` file provides unique names for each record
* A naming standard has been developed for adding entries to the `/etc/hosts` file 
* Use RHN Satellite Server to push out the `/etc/hosts` file
