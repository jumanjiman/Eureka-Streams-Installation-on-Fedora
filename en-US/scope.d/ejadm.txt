==== Manage a central document repository

The `ejadm` command administers a collection of documents. In the future,
the `ejadm` command will provide a front-end to version control 
and publishing, enabling users to:

* List documents by author, client name, or document title
* Search documents
* Publish documents
* Manage revisions
* Check-out documents
* Check-out document _modules_; e.g., runbook procedures

IMPORTANT: The `ejadm` command does not _yet_ provide
the features listed above.
