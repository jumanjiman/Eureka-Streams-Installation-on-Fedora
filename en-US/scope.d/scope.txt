=== Scope

==== Focus on content, _not_ formatting

This documentation system leverages open-source tools
to create professional documents without worrying about the format. 
It provides several advantages:

* Rapid document creation
  - Include files directly
  - Manage revisions
  - Publish content automatically
* Automatic formatting based on stylesheets
  - Consistent look and feel
  - Format is based on semantic content
* Automatic creation of
  - table of contents
  - table of figures
  - index (based on tagged content)


==== Create professional documents based on templates

This package provides the `ej` command for creating
documents. The `ej` command is short for *engagement journal* 
and does several things:

* Creates a working directory containing a template engagement journal
* Enables the author to work with plain-text files
* Provides a `Makefile`, which... 
  . converts plain-text, lightweight markup into `docbook`
  . converts `docbook` into well-formatted output, such as PDF

NOTE: The `ej` command provides the above features _now_.


==== Manage a central document repository

The `ejadm` command administers a collection of documents. In the future,
the `ejadm` command will provide a front-end to version control 
and publishing, enabling users to:

* List documents by author, client name, or document title
* Search documents
* Publish documents
* Manage revisions
* Check-out documents

IMPORTANT: The `ejadm` command does not _yet_ provide
the features listed above.

==== Another scope element

Use asciidoc in your source to denote things that 
should be *bold* or _italicized_.

.List titles are optional and begin with a dot (no space)
* First bullet point in no implied order of progression
* Second bullet point
- Sub-bullet
- Another sub-bullet
* Third bullet point
* Denote commands, such as the `cat /proc/cpuinfo` command, in backticks

.List titles are bold, and _this portion is also italicized_
. Numbered lists are good for procedures
. Pretty easy, right?
.. A sub-step
.. Second sub-step
. Third major step
