==== Create professional documents based on templates

This package provides the `ej` command for creating
documents. The `ej` command is short for *engagement journal* 
and does several things:

* Creates a working directory containing a template engagement journal
* Enables the author to work with plain-text files
* Provides a `Makefile`, which... 
  . converts plain-text, lightweight markup into `docbook`
  . converts `docbook` into well-formatted output, such as PDF

NOTE: The `ej` command provides the above features _now_.
