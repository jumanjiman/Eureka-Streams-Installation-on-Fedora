____
This guide provides the basic information for getting
Eureka Streams compiled and built in a local environment
to be run.  The steps provided in this guide are for
building a developerâ€™s version of Eureka Streams only.
A number of additional configuration options are available
for more sophisticated builds for Eureka Streams to run
in an enterprise environment.  Do not use these build
commands to build to a production environment.
