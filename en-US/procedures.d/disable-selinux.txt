==== Set SELinux to not enforce security

For now, set SELinux to permissive mode. After Eureka Streams is up and 
running, we can worry about implementing an SELinux policy
or otherwise securing the apps. Until it's running, there
is no sense in obscuring application or build issues with
strong security. Remember, this initial installation is 'not suitable
for production use'.

. As `root`, modify `/etc/sysconfig/selinux` to read:
+
----
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#   enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#   permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#   disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.
SELINUX=permissive
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are:
#   targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#   strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted

. As `root`, set permissive mode

setenforce 0

WARNING: SELinux should be enabled and restricted on production servers.
This step is only for use during initial testing.
