== How to install Eureka Streams on Fedora

This document is merely a stub text at this point.
Hopefully I'll have plenty of time to work on it
in the coming days.

Once the document has enough substance to
actually install Eureka Streams, I'll make
PDF and HTML versions available for easy
consumption.

Currently it's available in Asciidoc source only.
Feedback and contributions are welcome.
