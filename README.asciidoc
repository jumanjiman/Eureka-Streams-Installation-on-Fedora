== How to install Eureka Streams on Fedora

This document is merely a stub text at this point.
Hopefully I'll have plenty of time to work on it
in the coming days.

A PDF version is available on Github 
http://github.com/jumanjiman/Eureka-Streams-Installation-on-Fedora/downloads[in the downloads section]
for easy consumption.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
