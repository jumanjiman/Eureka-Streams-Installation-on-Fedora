== How to install Eureka Streams on Fedora

This document is a work-in-process.
Currently it includes steps to install and compile Eureka Streams
plus dependencies, up to and including building the database.
Unfortunately, the DB scripts are puking with an error.
The error and relevant output are included in the doc.

A PDF version is available on Github 
http://github.com/jumanjiman/Eureka-Streams-Installation-on-Fedora/downloads[in the downloads section]
for easy consumption.

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
